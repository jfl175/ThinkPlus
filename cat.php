                    <h2>ABOUT IPMAT</h2>
                    <p class="lead">IPMAT is a five-year IPM admissions test administered by IIM Indore and IIM Rohtak (Integrated Programme in Management). For those who have completed the 12th standard, IIM Indore offers a dual degree programme (Bachelors + Masters). It is a programme that permits students to enrol in an IIM after they have completed their 12th grade. Aspirants must pass the IPMAT exam to be considered for admission to the IPM programme, and those who are shortlisted must subsequently pass the Written Ability Test (WAT), Personal Interview (PI), and Video Assessment (VA) round. IPMAT results are accepted for admission to Nirma University's BBA-MBA integrated programme, in addition to IIM Indore. IIM Rohtak has also launched an Integrated Programme in Management, which is administered by a distinct IPMAT.</p>

                    <h2>WHY IPM COURSE?</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">1. The Brand Value!</p>
                    <p class="lead">The unrivalled IIM degree adds significant value to a candidate's resume. Without having to take a separate undergraduate course in any other field of study, a 10+2 student can strive to benefit from this brand value.</p>
                    
                    <div class="p-2"></div>

                    <p class="lead mb-0">2. What after 10+2?</p>
                    <p class="lead">The IPM programme serves as a stepping stone to the top IIMs. Because IPM is attracting the attention of young applicants, it offers an opportunity to get into an IIM when the competition is extremely low. While over lakhs of students took the CAT exam, which is growing at an exponential rate, just about 17550 students took the IPM exam in 2020. When compared to B.Tech graduates who seek an MBA following engineering and spend 6 years doing so, IPM saves students one year because it takes only 5 years to complete.</p>
                    
                    <div class="p-2"></div>
                    
                    <p class="lead mb-0">3. State-of-the-art curriculum</p>
                    <p class="lead">A big reason for IPM’s uniqueness is its well-charted curriculum. IPM imparts the necessary knowledge and skills, not just in the field of management but in various other subjects. The students’ intellect is nourished by the world-class IIM faculty.</p>

                    <p class="lead">IPMAT assesses your capacity to think critically. Therefore choosing the proper approach to a topic is crucial. Knowledge of the themes and types of questions asked in these situations is essential. Get a firm grasp on the fundamentals and take practice examinations regularly. Analyze each question to determine your strong and weak points. Read a lot for the Verbal Ability section to improve your reading speed and comprehension. Regularly read newspapers to stay informed about current events, which can aid you in the WAT and PI processes. </p>
