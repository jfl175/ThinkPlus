                    <h2>ABOUT CAT ENTRANCE EXAM</h2>
                    <p class="lead">The Common Admission Test (CAT) is a national management entrance exam for admission to IIMs and other top B-schools. After passing the CAT test, students are eligible for admission to management programmes such as PGP, PGDM, PGPEM, EPGP, PGPBM, and PGPEX at various IIMs around the country. There is no set number of attempts required to pass the CAT. IIMs are required by the Government of India to reserve 15% of seats for SC candidates, 7.5 percent for ST candidates, and 27 percent for NC-OBC candidates. Persons with Benchmark Disabilities are also given 5% of the seats. Scholarships are also available at IIMs for deserving students who require financial assistance. The Indian Institutes of Management are public institutions that have complete autonomy over their day-to-day operations and curriculum. In India, there are currently 20 IIMs operating as public autonomous institutes.</p>
